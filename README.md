# Advent Of Code 2018
 Advent of Code 2018 üéÑ Solutions in Python

I am using Python to solve the AoC 2018 puzzles, as this is an excellent opportunity for me to learn and master Python finally.

Therefore, my solutions are most probably unoptimized, sometimes naive, and mostly pure brute-force. If you have any questions, comments or concerns about my code, please do let me know.
